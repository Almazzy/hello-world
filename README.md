My Name is Abo Issac
I am old programmer since 1990 on Windows platform
Currently working as senior App Dev to manage company applications and small dev projects. 
Due to war in my country, I started to refresh my experince on development
It seems that the trends go to the internet and I need to start capturing new technology
HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Python ...etc.
Well, frankly it is spaghati :-)
So, I decided to go back to my old corner of VB/C# using ASP and maybe using Xamarine.
To create mobile applications.
I will also invest more time on Sharepoint. However, it needs a dedicated server which I can not invest right now.
In this new journy I met GitHub and seems to me it is a replacment for MS-TFS that we are using.
OK
That is more than enought I think :-)
